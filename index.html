                <p>
                    Know thyself. Building off of the Quantified Self movement (measuring things about you), and the recent NSA scandal, I think there is no better time than now to start learning about what our data tells about us. This service will be able to tell you routines you have, the places you go, the things you buy. And it will be about to tell you when you change those habits. Anamolies in the data are sometimes more interesting the the routine.

                <h3 class="information-head">What do you get?</h3>
                <p>
                    You get what you should already have by default: ownership of your information. Combined with our software, you will be able to gain insight into your life. We provide pretty Graphs, Charts, Tables, etc that will help you understand yourself. And if you are suber paranoid, you will be able to see what the perfect spy could possibly know about you.

                <p>
                    Well, kinda. Except our software will encrypt your data with the latest and greatest encryption mechanicsm we can possibly get our hands. You won't have to worry about a thing. Trust us. We won't sell your information to any goverment or spy agency. Mainly becuase we won't have access to it. You will own it. You will store it. Not, us. Not some crappy cloud serve based in who-knows-where. Maybe you could see it though? Maybe there could be some important information researchers could do with all this very detailed information. I don't know. I'm kinda just writing stuff as filler.
